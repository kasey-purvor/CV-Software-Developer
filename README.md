As a young child I was fascinated by technology and science. Aged 9 I had a PC that was too slow to play the games I had. I found myself learning everything I could about computer hardware. Obsessed with specs, I knew every hardware initialism on the market. Eventually after years of begging I was allowed to build my own computer from scratch for my gaming exploits. It was probably one of the first SLI dual GPU machines around and I still have it now, 15 years on. 

At school my love of physics and astronomy led me to applied physics and onto engineering at University. Fascinated by the technical subjects, by the time I graduated I knew little about the industry & work culture I was to join. I had all the technical knowledge and no clue what to expect. 

Problem solving is what I love and do best and as an engineer I honed this skill; as well as practicing creativity, product management and communication.  Having felt slightly stagnant and unrewarded as a mechanical engineer, I find myself looking to make the move into software - driven by a desire to be challenged and rewarded in a flexible work environment. As a dependable and pragmatic fast learner who thrives in challenging roles, I feel there is no better industry for me. It is dynamic, rewarding and exiting - I think of it like a frontier of human innovation, and I intend to find myself there.

## Skills


- **Self Starter**  
	* Starting a new engineering role during lockdown, I was unable to undergo training and therefore unable to design the heavily regulated hydraulic products. With my job in jeopardy I asked to be given a chance to prove myself, I was given a two-part new problem that did not require training. Six months on I had carved myself a new research/designer role where I dealt with novel problems (where nobody had any experience), performing  research into many new concepts I proved myself invaluable. I am proud how I handled this period and thrived. The work I did had very little guidance, and required me to be **creative**, **resilient**, **dependable**. | <a href='https://github.com/kasey-purvor/CV-Software-Developer/blob/main/engineering_portfolio.md#ballistic-screens'> ***Ballistic-screens*** </a> | <a href='https://github.com/kasey-purvor/CV-Software-Developer/blob/main/engineering_portfolio.md#banjo-bolt'> ***Banjo Bolt*** </a> |   
	* During my time at Makers Academy, I found myself on a project using the MERN stack. With my previous experience in Ruby, fairly new to Javascript and completely new to MongoDB, React and Node.js, I had to apply my self-starting ability to create a graphical progress bar that fileld up when users input their thoughts. Navigating numerous blockers along the way I succeeded. | <a href='https://github.com/kasey-purvor/Grappitude'> **Grappitude** </a> | 
- **Adaptable** 
	* Whether tackling new concepts or familiar problems, I approach everything with the same pragmatism and logic seen throughout my career. | <a href='https://github.com/kasey-purvor/CV-Software-Developer/blob/main/engineering_portfolio.md#contamination-study'> ***contamination study***  </a> 
 - **Team Player** 
	* Knowing when to take a leadership role, be a motivator or to just ensure you pull your weight. Team working is has been a vital part of my life for as long as I can remember, not just in academically or professionally, but in the lifestyle and hobbies I choose. | <a href='https://github.com/kasey-purvor/CV-Software-Developer/blob/main/engineering_portfolio.md#university-group-project'>***university group project*** </a> |
 - **Attention To Detail** 
	* Having worked in an industry where products are designed to within 1/1000th of millimeter and the slightest miscalculation could cause serious injury or worse, an eye for detail is not something I could have survived without. | <a href='https://github.com/kasey-purvor/CV-Software-Developer/blob/main/engineering_portfolio.md#safety-mechanism'>***safety mechanism*** </a> |

## Interests

- Computers! Originally spurred on simply by having a PC too slow to play the games I had. I found myself learning everything I could about computer hardware. Obsessed with specs, I knew every hardware initialism on the market. Eventually after years of nagging/begging I was allowed to build my own computer from scratch for my gaming exploits. It was probably one of the first SLI dual GPU machines around and I still have it now, 15 years on.

- Mountain Sports. I began attending Scouts from age 9 and finished at 16. In that time, I had the privilege of
 accompanying my scout troop on countless trips and expeditions domestically and internationally; to places
 such as Wales, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and the USA. The highlight of which, in 2008, was a month-long
 trip to Alaska involving a week-long expedition up mount Flower, an equally long canoeing trip down the
 Matanuska River and numerous other excursions partaking in outdoors activities. The whole experience
 provided invaluable team working, resilience and survival experience which was influential on me from a
 young age.

- I am hugely interested in Physics and Astronomy. Since a young age I was always inquisitive about the nature
 of things; I became absolutely fascinated with physics, which was pivotal in my progression towards
 engineering. I have read some of the most popular, and some more niche, books spanning space, astronomy
 and theoretical & particle physics.

- I am an avid mountain biker. I am out riding my bike almost every weekend.

- Rugby is a sport in which I am very passionate. Having played from ages 7 to 20, for Sunday Club, school and
 University, I follow most international & top league fixtures and regularly attend games at Twickenham.

- Music has always been something I am very passionate about. I began playing the piano aged 7 and finished
 my grade 7 exams aged 17. Aside from playing music, I regularly attend music festivals and gigs with my friends.
