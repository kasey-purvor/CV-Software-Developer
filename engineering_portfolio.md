## My Work At Servotest
My most recent employement began during the first lockdown as was challenging for a number of reasons. As the company was unprepared for home working, I was unable to be trained in the heavily regulated hydraulics. Therefore I seeked out problems that were novel to the company, and therefore nobody was better suited than me through experience. I am proud hopw I handled this period and thrived performing work that had many new concepts. The work I did had very little guidance, and required me to be resilliant, patient, dependable and an strong self starter. The following outlines some of the work I did during my time there. 

### Ballistic Screens
> During testing of a large hydraulic piston, a fluid carrying component failed. The failed component was ejected at speed and punctured the metal ceiling of the workshop. As a > result an investigation into the component was launched (<a> banjo-bolt </a>) and the design of adequate safety screens was comissioned. Both were delagated to me.  
>
> To design adequate safety screens I would to know 2 properties of the projectiles: mass & velocity. I began by identifying the largest & longest projectile (as this would be  > the worst case) and based my analysis on this. I then studied the ***pressure test safety*** document for a way to model the acceleration (figure 1). Along with the eqautions > of motion (figure 2) I came up with a calculation for determining the escape velocity of the component (figure 3) by the large red arrow.
